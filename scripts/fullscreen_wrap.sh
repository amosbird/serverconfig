# + Usage: fullscreen_wrap.sh <command>
# +
# +   This script checks whether the focused window is currently in fullscreen
# +   mode. If so, it disables the fullscreen for it, runs the passed command
# +   and enables fullscreen for the window again once the command exits.
# +
# +   If the focused window is currently not in fullscreen mode, it will
# +   simply run the command and exit.
