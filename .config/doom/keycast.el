  "Whether to display the binding in the mode line of the selected window.

This predicate is used while updating the mode line of a window
to determine whether the current command and its key binding
should be displayed in its mode line.  The function is called
with no argument and act on `selected-window'.

`moody-window-active-p'
  Return non-nil if the temporarily selected window is the
  active window, i.e. if it is the selected window as far
  as the user is concerned.  Load the `moody' library to be
  able to use this.

`powerline-selected-window-active'
  This function behaves like `moody-window-active-p', but
  is defined in the `powerline' library.  Load that library
  to be able to use this.

`keycast-bottom-right-window-p'
  Return non-nil if the temporarily selected window is the
  right-most bottom window of its frame.

`keycast-active-frame-bottom-right-p'
  Return non-nil if the temporarily selected window is the
  right-most bottom window of frame that is active as far
  as the user is concerned.  If neither the `moody' nor
  the `powerline' library is loaded, then behave the same
  as `keycast-bottom-right-window-p'."

  "Alist used to substituted events and/or commands for display.

Occationally it might be necessary to pretend you pressed another
key than the one you actually pressed (because watchers don't
care about your weird key bindings), or to hide certain commands
\(such as `self-insert-command').  This option allows doing that
and more.

Each element has the form (MATCH EVENT COMMAND).  MATH is an
event or a command.  When a command is invoked then this package
looks for a MATCH for that.  If there is a match, then that the
respective EVENT and COMMAND are used.  If not, then it looks
for a MATCH for that instead.

If either EVENT or COMMAND is nil, then neither the event nor
the command is shown (regardless of the value of the other).
Otherwise if EVENT is t then the actual event is shown, else
it has to be a string to be shown instead.  Likewise COMMAND
can be t to show the actual COMMAND or a symbol to be shown
instead."
