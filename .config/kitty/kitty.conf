#: Fonts {{{

#: kitty has very powerful font management. You can configure
#: individual font faces and even specify special fonts for particular
#: characters.

font_family      monospace
bold_font        auto
italic_font      auto
bold_italic_font auto

#: You can specify different fonts for the bold/italic/bold-italic
#: variants. To get a full list of supported fonts use the `kitty
#: +list-fonts` command. By default they are derived automatically, by
#: the OSes font system. When bold_font or bold_italic_font is set to
#: auto on macOS, the priority of bold fonts is semi-bold, bold,
#: heavy. Setting them manually is useful for font families that have
#: many weight variants like Book, Medium, Thick, etc. For example::

#:     font_family      Operator Mono Book
#:     bold_font        Operator Mono Medium
#:     italic_font      Operator Mono Book Italic
#:     bold_italic_font Operator Mono Medium Italic

font_size 14

#: Font size (in pts)

force_ltr no

#: kitty does not support BIDI (bidirectional text), however, for RTL
#: scripts, words are automatically displayed in RTL. That is to say,
#: in an RTL script, the words "HELLO WORLD" display in kitty as
#: "WORLD HELLO", and if you try to select a substring of an RTL-
#: shaped string, you will get the character that would be there had
#: the the string been LTR. For example, assuming the Hebrew word
#: ××¨××©×××, selecting the character that on the screen appears to be ×
#: actually writes into the selection buffer the character ×.  kitty's
#: default behavior is useful in conjunction with a filter to reverse
#: the word order, however, if you wish to manipulate RTL glyphs, it
#: can be very challenging to work with, so this option is provided to
#: turn it off. Furthermore, this option can be used with the command
#: line program GNU FriBidi
#: <https://github.com/fribidi/fribidi#executable> to get BIDI
#: support, because it will force kitty to always treat the text as
#: LTR, which FriBidi expects for terminals.

# symbol_map

#: E.g. symbol_map U+E0A0-U+E0A3,U+E0C0-U+E0C7 PowerlineSymbols

#: Map the specified Unicode codepoints to a particular font. Useful
#: if you need special rendering for some symbols, such as for
#: Powerline. Avoids the need for patched fonts. Each Unicode code
#: point is specified in the form `U+<code point in hexadecimal>`. You
#: can specify multiple code points, separated by commas and ranges
#: separated by hyphens. This option can be specified multiple times.
#: The syntax is::

#:     symbol_map codepoints Font Family Name

narrow_symbols U+23CE 1

#: E.g. narrow_symbols U+E0A0-U+E0A3,U+E0C0-U+E0C7 1

#: Usually, for Private Use Unicode characters and some symbol/dingbat
#: characters, if the character is followed by one or more spaces,
#: kitty will use those extra cells to render the character larger, if
#: the character in the font has a wide aspect ratio. Using this
#: option you can force kitty to restrict the specified code points to
#: render in the specified number of cells (defaulting to one cell).
#: This option can be specified multiple times. The syntax is::

#:     narrow_symbols codepoints [optionally the number of cells]

disable_ligatures never

#: Choose how you want to handle multi-character ligatures. The
#: default is to always render them. You can tell kitty to not render
#: them when the cursor is over them by using cursor to make editing
#: easier, or have kitty never render them at all by using always, if
#: you don't like them. The ligature strategy can be set per-window
#: either using the kitty remote control facility or by defining
#: shortcuts for it in kitty.conf, for example::

#:     map alt+1 disable_ligatures_in active always
#:     map alt+2 disable_ligatures_in all never
#:     map alt+3 disable_ligatures_in tab cursor

#: Note that this refers to programming ligatures, typically
#: implemented using the calt OpenType feature. For disabling general
#: ligatures, use the font_features option.

# font_features

#: E.g. font_features none

#: Choose exactly which OpenType features to enable or disable. This
#: is useful as some fonts might have features worthwhile in a
#: terminal. For example, Fira Code includes a discretionary feature,
#: zero, which in that font changes the appearance of the zero (0), to
#: make it more easily distinguishable from Ã. Fira Code also includes
#: other discretionary features known as Stylistic Sets which have the
#: tags ss01 through ss20.

#: For the exact syntax to use for individual features, see the
#: HarfBuzz documentation <https://harfbuzz.github.io/harfbuzz-hb-
#: common.html#hb-feature-from-string>.

#: Note that this code is indexed by PostScript name, and not the font
#: family. This allows you to define very precise feature settings;
#: e.g. you can disable a feature in the italic font but not in the
#: regular font.

#: On Linux, font features are first read from the FontConfig database
#: and then this option is applied, so they can be configured in a
#: single, central place.

#: To get the PostScript name for a font, use `kitty +list-fonts
#: --psnames`:

#: .. code-block:: sh

#:     $ kitty +list-fonts --psnames | grep Fira
#:     Fira Code
#:     Fira Code Bold (FiraCode-Bold)
#:     Fira Code Light (FiraCode-Light)
#:     Fira Code Medium (FiraCode-Medium)
#:     Fira Code Regular (FiraCode-Regular)
#:     Fira Code Retina (FiraCode-Retina)

#: The part in brackets is the PostScript name.

#: Enable alternate zero and oldstyle numerals::

#:     font_features FiraCode-Retina +zero +onum

#: Enable only alternate zero in the bold font::

#:     font_features FiraCode-Bold +zero

#: Disable the normal ligatures, but keep the calt feature which (in
#: this font) breaks up monotony::

#:     font_features TT2020StyleB-Regular -liga +calt

#: In conjunction with force_ltr, you may want to disable Arabic
#: shaping entirely, and only look at their isolated forms if they
#: show up in a document. You can do this with e.g.::

#:     font_features UnifontMedium +isol -medi -fina -init

# modify_font

#: Modify font characteristics such as the position or thickness of
#: the underline and strikethrough. The modifications can have the
#: suffix px for pixels or % for percentage of original value. No
#: suffix means use pts. For example::

#:     modify_font underline_position -2
#:     modify_font underline_thickness 150%
#:     modify_font strikethrough_position 2px

#: Additionally, you can modify the size of the cell in which each
#: font glyph is rendered and the baseline at which the glyph is
#: placed in the cell. For example::

#:     modify_font cell_width 80%
#:     modify_font cell_height -2px
#:     modify_font baseline 3

modify_font cell_height 110%

#: Note that modifying the baseline will automatically adjust the
#: underline and strikethrough positions by the same amount.
#: Increasing the baseline raises glyphs inside the cell and
#: decreasing it lowers them. Decreasing the cell size might cause
#: rendering artifacts, so use with care.

box_drawing_scale 0.001, 1, 1.5, 2

#: The sizes of the lines used for the box drawing Unicode characters.
#: These values are in pts. They will be scaled by the monitor DPI to
#: arrive at a pixel value. There must be four values corresponding to
#: thin, normal, thick, and very thick lines.

#: }}}

#: Cursor customization {{{

cursor #b8860b

#: Default cursor color. If set to the special value none the cursor
#: will be rendered with a "reverse video" effect. It's color will be
#: the color of the text in the cell it is over and the text will be
#: rendered with the background color of the cell. Note that if the
#: program running in the terminal sets a cursor color, this takes
#: precedence. Also, the cursor colors are modified if the cell
#: background and foreground colors have very low contrast.

cursor_text_color #111111

#: The color of text under the cursor. If you want it rendered with
#: the background color of the cell underneath instead, use the
#: special keyword: background. Note that if cursor is set to none
#: then this option is ignored.

cursor_shape block

#: The cursor shape can be one of block, beam, underline. Note that
#: when reloading the config this will be changed only if the cursor
#: shape has not been set by the program running in the terminal. This
#: sets the default cursor shape, applications running in the terminal
#: can override it. In particular, shell integration
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/> in kitty sets
#: the cursor shape to beam at shell prompts. You can avoid this by
#: setting shell_integration to no-cursor.

cursor_beam_thickness 1.5

#: The thickness of the beam cursor (in pts).

cursor_underline_thickness 2.0

#: The thickness of the underline cursor (in pts).

cursor_blink_interval 0
# cursor_blink_interval 0.5 ease-in-out

#: The interval to blink the cursor (in seconds). Set to zero to
#: disable blinking. Negative values mean use system default. Note
#: that the minimum interval will be limited to repaint_delay.

cursor_stop_blinking_after 15.0

#: Stop blinking cursor after the specified number of seconds of
#: keyboard inactivity. Set to zero to never stop blinking.

#: }}}

#: Scrollback {{{

scrollback_lines 2000

#: Number of lines of history to keep in memory for scrolling back.
#: Memory is allocated on demand. Negative numbers are (effectively)
#: infinite scrollback. Note that using very large scrollback is not
#: recommended as it can slow down performance of the terminal and
#: also use large amounts of RAM. Instead, consider using
#: scrollback_pager_history_size. Note that on config reload if this
#: is changed it will only affect newly created windows, not existing
#: ones.

scrollback_pager less --chop-long-lines --RAW-CONTROL-CHARS +INPUT_LINE_NUMBER

#: Program with which to view scrollback in a new window. The
#: scrollback buffer is passed as STDIN to this program. If you change
#: it, make sure the program you use can handle ANSI escape sequences
#: for colors and text formatting. INPUT_LINE_NUMBER in the command
#: line above will be replaced by an integer representing which line
#: should be at the top of the screen. Similarly CURSOR_LINE and
#: CURSOR_COLUMN will be replaced by the current cursor position or
#: set to 0 if there is no cursor, for example, when showing the last
#: command output.

scrollback_pager_history_size 0

#: Separate scrollback history size (in MB), used only for browsing
#: the scrollback buffer with pager. This separate buffer is not
#: available for interactive scrolling but will be piped to the pager
#: program when viewing scrollback buffer in a separate window. The
#: current implementation stores the data in UTF-8, so approximatively
#: 10000 lines per megabyte at 100 chars per line, for pure ASCII,
#: unformatted text. A value of zero or less disables this feature.
#: The maximum allowed size is 4GB. Note that on config reload if this
#: is changed it will only affect newly created windows, not existing
#: ones.

scrollback_fill_enlarged_window no

#: Fill new space with lines from the scrollback buffer after
#: enlarging a window.

wheel_scroll_multiplier 1.0

#: Multiplier for the number of lines scrolled by the mouse wheel.
#: Note that this is only used for low precision scrolling devices,
#: not for high precision scrolling devices on platforms such as macOS
#: and Wayland. Use negative numbers to change scroll direction. See
#: also wheel_scroll_min_lines.

wheel_scroll_min_lines 1

#: The minimum number of lines scrolled by the mouse wheel. The scroll
#: multiplier wheel_scroll_multiplier only takes effect after it
#: reaches this number. Note that this is only used for low precision
#: scrolling devices like wheel mice that scroll by very small amounts
#: when using the wheel. With a negative number, the minimum number of
#: lines will always be added.

touch_scroll_multiplier 1.0

#: Multiplier for the number of lines scrolled by a touchpad. Note
#: that this is only used for high precision scrolling devices on
#: platforms such as macOS and Wayland. Use negative numbers to change
#: scroll direction.

#: }}}

#: Mouse {{{

mouse_hide_wait 0

#: Hide mouse cursor after the specified number of seconds of the
#: mouse not being used. Set to zero to disable mouse cursor hiding.
#: Set to a negative value to hide the mouse cursor immediately when
#: typing text. Disabled by default on macOS as getting it to work
#: robustly with the ever-changing sea of bugs that is Cocoa is too
#: much effort.

url_color #0087bd
url_style curly

#: The color and style for highlighting URLs on mouse-over. url_style
#: can be one of: none, straight, double, curly, dotted, dashed.

open_url_with default

#: The program to open clicked URLs. The special value default means
#: to use the operating system's default URL handler (open on macOS
#: and xdg-open on Linux).

url_prefixes file ftp ftps gemini git gopher http https irc ircs kitty mailto news sftp ssh tg

#: The set of URL prefixes to look for when detecting a URL under the
#: mouse cursor.

detect_urls no

#: Detect URLs under the mouse. Detected URLs are highlighted with an
#: underline and the mouse cursor becomes a hand over them. Even if
#: this option is disabled, URLs are still clickable.

# url_excluded_characters

#: Additional characters to be disallowed from URLs, when detecting
#: URLs under the mouse cursor. By default, all characters that are
#: legal in URLs are allowed.

copy_on_select no

#: Copy to clipboard or a private buffer on select. With this set to
#: clipboard, selecting text with the mouse will cause the text to be
#: copied to clipboard. Useful on platforms such as macOS that do not
#: have the concept of primary selection. You can instead specify a
#: name such as a1 to copy to a private kitty buffer. Map a shortcut
#: with the paste_from_buffer action to paste from this private
#: buffer. For example::

#:     copy_on_select a1
#:     map shift+cmd+v paste_from_buffer a1

#: Note that copying to the clipboard is a security risk, as all
#: programs, including websites open in your browser can read the
#: contents of the system clipboard.

paste_actions quote-urls-at-prompt

#: A comma separated list of actions to take when pasting text into
#: the terminal. The supported paste actions are:

#: quote-urls-at-prompt:
#:     If the text being pasted is a URL and the cursor is at a shell prompt,
#:     automatically quote the URL (needs shell_integration).
#: confirm:
#:     Confirm the paste if bracketed paste mode is not active or there is more
#:     a large amount of text being pasted.
#: filter:
#:     Run the filter_paste() function from the file paste-actions.py in
#:     the kitty config directory on the pasted text. The text returned by the
#:     function will be actually pasted.

strip_trailing_spaces never

#: Remove spaces at the end of lines when copying to clipboard. A
#: value of smart will do it when using normal selections, but not
#: rectangle selections. A value of always will always do it.

select_by_word_characters @-./_~?&=%+#

#: Characters considered part of a word when double clicking. In
#: addition to these characters any character that is marked as an
#: alphanumeric character in the Unicode database will be matched.

# select_by_word_characters_forward

#: Characters considered part of a word when extending the selection
#: forward on double clicking. In addition to these characters any
#: character that is marked as an alphanumeric character in the
#: Unicode database will be matched.

#: If empty (default) select_by_word_characters will be used for both
#: directions.

click_interval -1.0

#: The interval between successive clicks to detect double/triple
#: clicks (in seconds). Negative numbers will use the system default
#: instead, if available, or fallback to 0.5.

focus_follows_mouse no

#: Set the active window to the window under the mouse when moving the
#: mouse around.

pointer_shape_when_grabbed arrow

#: The shape of the mouse pointer when the program running in the
#: terminal grabs the mouse. Valid values are: arrow, beam and hand.

default_pointer_shape beam

#: The default shape of the mouse pointer. Valid values are: arrow,
#: beam and hand.

pointer_shape_when_dragging beam

#: The default shape of the mouse pointer when dragging across text.
#: Valid values are: arrow, beam and hand.

#: Mouse actions {{{

#: Mouse buttons can be mapped to perform arbitrary actions. The
#: syntax is:

#: .. code-block:: none

#:     mouse_map button-name event-type modes action

#: Where button-name is one of left, middle, right, b1 ... b8 with
#: added keyboard modifiers. For example: ctrl+shift+left refers to
#: holding the Ctrl+Shift keys while clicking with the left mouse
#: button. The value b1 ... b8 can be used to refer to up to eight
#: buttons on a mouse.

#: event-type is one of press, release, doublepress, triplepress,
#: click, doubleclick. modes indicates whether the action is performed
#: when the mouse is grabbed by the program running in the terminal,
#: or not. The values are grabbed or ungrabbed or a comma separated
#: combination of them. grabbed refers to when the program running in
#: the terminal has requested mouse events. Note that the click and
#: double click events have a delay of click_interval to disambiguate
#: from double and triple presses.

#: You can run kitty with the kitty --debug-input command line option
#: to see mouse events. See the builtin actions below to get a sense
#: of what is possible.

#: If you want to unmap an action, map it to no_op. For example, to
#: disable opening of URLs with a plain click::

#:     mouse_map left click ungrabbed no_op

#: See all the mappable actions including mouse actions here
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/actions/>.

#: .. note::
#:     Once a selection is started, releasing the button that started it will
#:     automatically end it and no release event will be dispatched.

clear_all_mouse_actions no

#: Remove all mouse action definitions up to this point. Useful, for
#: instance, to remove the default mouse actions.

#: Click the link under the mouse or move the cursor

mouse_map left click ungrabbed mouse_handle_click selection link prompt

#::  First check for a selection and if one exists do nothing. Then
#::  check for a link under the mouse cursor and if one exists, click
#::  it. Finally check if the click happened at the current shell
#::  prompt and if so, move the cursor to the click location. Note
#::  that this requires shell integration
#::  <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/> to work.

#: Click the link under the mouse or move the cursor even when grabbed

mouse_map shift+left click grabbed,ungrabbed mouse_handle_click selection link prompt

#::  Same as above, except that the action is performed even when the
#::  mouse is grabbed by the program running in the terminal.

#: Click the link under the mouse cursor

mouse_map ctrl+shift+left release grabbed,ungrabbed mouse_handle_click link

#::  Variant with Ctrl+Shift is present because the simple click based
#::  version has an unavoidable delay of click_interval, to
#::  disambiguate clicks from double clicks.

#: Discard press event for link click

mouse_map ctrl+shift+left press grabbed discard_event

#::  Prevent this press event from being sent to the program that has
#::  grabbed the mouse, as the corresponding release event is used to
#::  open a URL.

#: Paste from the primary selection

mouse_map middle release ungrabbed paste_from_selection

#: Start selecting text

mouse_map left press ungrabbed mouse_selection normal

#: Start selecting text in a rectangle

mouse_map ctrl+alt+left press ungrabbed mouse_selection rectangle

#: Select a line

mouse_map left triplepress ungrabbed mouse_selection line

#: Select line from point

mouse_map ctrl+alt+left triplepress ungrabbed mouse_selection line_from_point

#::  Select from the clicked point to the end of the line.

#: Extend the current selection

mouse_map right press ungrabbed mouse_selection extend

#::  If you want only the end of the selection to be moved instead of
#::  the nearest boundary, use move-end instead of extend.

#: Paste from the primary selection even when grabbed

mouse_map shift+middle release ungrabbed,grabbed paste_selection
mouse_map shift+middle press grabbed discard_event

#: Start selecting text even when grabbed

mouse_map shift+left press ungrabbed,grabbed mouse_selection normal

#: }}}

#: }}}

#: Performance tuning {{{

repaint_delay 10

#: Delay between screen updates (in milliseconds). Decreasing it,
#: increases frames-per-second (FPS) at the cost of more CPU usage.
#: The default value yields ~100 FPS which is more than sufficient for
#: most uses. Note that to actually achieve 100 FPS, you have to
#: either set sync_to_monitor to no or use a monitor with a high
#: refresh rate. Also, to minimize latency when there is pending input
#: to be processed, this option is ignored.

input_delay 3

#: Delay before input from the program running in the terminal is
#: processed (in milliseconds). Note that decreasing it will increase
#: responsiveness, but also increase CPU usage and might cause flicker
#: in full screen programs that redraw the entire screen on each loop,
#: because kitty is so fast that partial screen updates will be drawn.

sync_to_monitor no

#: Sync screen updates to the refresh rate of the monitor. This
#: prevents screen tearing
#: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing> when scrolling.
#: However, it limits the rendering speed to the refresh rate of your
#: monitor. With a very high speed mouse/high keyboard repeat rate,
#: you may notice some slight input latency. If so, set this to no.

#: }}}

#: Terminal bell {{{

enable_audio_bell no

#: The audio bell. Useful to disable it in environments that require
#: silence.

visual_bell_duration 0.0

#: The visual bell duration (in seconds). Flash the screen when a bell
#: occurs for the specified number of seconds. Set to zero to disable.

visual_bell_color none

#: The color used by visual bell. Set to none will fall back to
#: selection background color. If you feel that the visual bell is too
#: bright, you can set it to a darker color.

window_alert_on_bell yes

#: Request window attention on bell. Makes the dock icon bounce on
#: macOS or the taskbar flash on linux.

bell_on_tab "ð "

#: Some text or a Unicode symbol to show on the tab if a window in the
#: tab that does not have focus has a bell. If you want to use leading
#: or trailing spaces, surround the text with quotes. See
#: tab_title_template for how this is rendered.

#: For backwards compatibility, values of yes, y and true are
#: converted to the default bell symbol and no, n, false and none are
#: converted to the empty string.

command_on_bell none

#: Program to run when a bell occurs. The environment variable
#: KITTY_CHILD_CMDLINE can be used to get the program running in the
#: window in which the bell occurred.

bell_path none

#: Path to a sound file to play as the bell sound. If set to none, the
#: system default bell sound is used. Must be in a format supported by
#: the operating systems sound API, such as WAV or OGA on Linux
#: (libcanberra) or AIFF, MP3 or WAV on macOS (NSSound)

#: }}}

#: Window layout {{{

remember_window_size  yes
initial_window_width  640
initial_window_height 400

#: If enabled, the window size will be remembered so that new
#: instances of kitty will have the same size as the previous
#: instance. If disabled, the window will initially have size
#: configured by initial_window_width/height, in pixels. You can use a
#: suffix of "c" on the width/height values to have them interpreted
#: as number of cells instead of pixels.

enabled_layouts stack

#: The enabled window layouts. A comma separated list of layout names.
#: The special value all means all layouts. The first listed layout
#: will be used as the startup layout. Default configuration is all
#: layouts in alphabetical order. For a list of available layouts, see
#: the layouts <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/overview/#layouts>.

window_resize_step_cells 2
window_resize_step_lines 2

#: The step size (in units of cell width/cell height) to use when
#: resizing kitty windows in a layout with the shortcut
#: start_resizing_window. The cells value is used for horizontal
#: resizing, and the lines value is used for vertical resizing.

window_border_width 0.5pt

#: The width of window borders. Can be either in pixels (px) or pts
#: (pt). Values in pts will be rounded to the nearest number of pixels
#: based on screen resolution. If not specified, the unit is assumed
#: to be pts. Note that borders are displayed only when more than one
#: window is visible. They are meant to separate multiple windows.

draw_minimal_borders yes

#: Draw only the minimum borders needed. This means that only the
#: borders that separate the inactive window from a neighbor are
#: drawn. Note that setting a non-zero window_margin_width overrides
#: this and causes all borders to be drawn.

window_margin_width 0

#: The window margin (in pts) (blank area outside the border). A
#: single value sets all four sides. Two values set the vertical and
#: horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal and bottom. Four
#: values set top, right, bottom and left.

single_window_margin_width -1

#: The window margin to use when only a single window is visible (in
#: pts). Negative values will cause the value of window_margin_width
#: to be used instead. A single value sets all four sides. Two values
#: set the vertical and horizontal sides. Three values set top,
#: horizontal and bottom. Four values set top, right, bottom and left.

window_padding_width 0

#: The window padding (in pts) (blank area between the text and the
#: window border). A single value sets all four sides. Two values set
#: the vertical and horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal
#: and bottom. Four values set top, right, bottom and left.

placement_strategy center

#: When the window size is not an exact multiple of the cell size, the
#: cell area of the terminal window will have some extra padding on
#: the sides. You can control how that padding is distributed with
#: this option. Using a value of center means the cell area will be
#: placed centrally. A value of top-left means the padding will be
#: only at the bottom and right edges.

active_border_color #00ff00

#: The color for the border of the active window. Set this to none to
#: not draw borders around the active window.

inactive_border_color #cccccc

#: The color for the border of inactive windows.

bell_border_color #ff5a00

#: The color for the border of inactive windows in which a bell has
#: occurred.

inactive_text_alpha 1.0

#: Fade the text in inactive windows by the specified amount (a number
#: between zero and one, with zero being fully faded).

hide_window_decorations no

#: Hide the window decorations (title-bar and window borders) with
#: yes. On macOS, titlebar-only can be used to only hide the titlebar.
#: Whether this works and exactly what effect it has depends on the
#: window manager/operating system. Note that the effects of changing
#: this option when reloading config are undefined.

window_logo_path none

#: Path to a logo image. Must be in PNG format. Relative paths are
#: interpreted relative to the kitty config directory. The logo is
#: displayed in a corner of every kitty window. The position is
#: controlled by window_logo_position. Individual windows can be
#: configured to have different logos either using the launch action
#: or the remote control <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/remote-
#: control/> facility.

window_logo_position bottom-right

#: Where to position the window logo in the window. The value can be
#: one of: top-left, top, top-right, left, center, right, bottom-left,
#: bottom, bottom-right.

window_logo_alpha 0.5

#: The amount the logo should be faded into the background. With zero
#: being fully faded and one being fully opaque.

resize_debounce_time 0.1

#: Choose how kitty draws a window while a resize is in progress. A
#: value of static means draw the current window contents, mostly
#: unchanged. A value of scale means draw the current window contents
#: scaled. A value of blank means draw a blank window. A value of size
#: means show the window size in cells.

resize_in_steps no

#: Resize the OS window in steps as large as the cells, instead of
#: with the usual pixel accuracy. Combined with initial_window_width
#: and initial_window_height in number of cells, this option can be
#: used to keep the margins as small as possible when resizing the OS
#: window. Note that this does not currently work on Wayland.

visual_window_select_characters 1234567890ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

#: The list of characters for visual window selection. For example,
#: for selecting a window to focus on with focus_visible_window. The
#: value should be a series of unique numbers or alphabets, case
#: insensitive, from the set [0-9A-Z]. Specify your preference as a
#: string of characters.

confirm_os_window_close 0

#: Ask for confirmation when closing an OS window or a tab with at
#: least this number of kitty windows in it by window manager (e.g.
#: clicking the window close button or pressing the operating system
#: shortcut to close windows) or by the close_tab action. A value of
#: zero disables confirmation. This confirmation also applies to
#: requests to quit the entire application (all OS windows, via the
#: quit action). Negative values are converted to positive ones,
#: however, with shell_integration enabled, using negative values
#: means windows sitting at a shell prompt are not counted, only
#: windows where some command is currently running. Note that if you
#: want confirmation when closing individual windows, you can map the
#: close_window_with_confirmation action.

#: }}}

#: Tab bar {{{

tab_bar_edge bottom

#: The edge to show the tab bar on, top or bottom.

tab_bar_margin_width 0.0

#: The margin to the left and right of the tab bar (in pts).

tab_bar_margin_height 0.0 0.0

#: The margin above and below the tab bar (in pts). The first number
#: is the margin between the edge of the OS Window and the tab bar.
#: The second number is the margin between the tab bar and the
#: contents of the current tab.

tab_bar_style fade

#: The tab bar style, can be one of:

#: fade
#:     Each tab's edges fade into the background color. (See also tab_fade)
#: slant
#:     Tabs look like the tabs in a physical file.
#: separator
#:     Tabs are separated by a configurable separator. (See also
#:     tab_separator)
#: powerline
#:     Tabs are shown as a continuous line with "fancy" separators.
#:     (See also tab_powerline_style)
#: custom
#:     A user-supplied Python function called draw_tab is loaded from the file
#:     tab_bar.py in the kitty config directory. For examples of how to
#:     write such a function, see the functions named draw_tab_with_* in
#:     kitty's source code: kitty/tab_bar.py. See also
#:     this discussion <https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/discussions/4447>
#:     for examples from kitty users.
#: hidden
#:     The tab bar is hidden. If you use this, you might want to create a mapping
#:     for the select_tab action which presents you with a list of tabs and
#:     allows for easy switching to a tab.

tab_bar_align left

#: The horizontal alignment of the tab bar, can be one of: left,
#: center, right.

tab_bar_min_tabs 2

#: The minimum number of tabs that must exist before the tab bar is
#: shown.

tab_switch_strategy previous

#: The algorithm to use when switching to a tab when the current tab
#: is closed. The default of previous will switch to the last used
#: tab. A value of left will switch to the tab to the left of the
#: closed tab. A value of right will switch to the tab to the right of
#: the closed tab. A value of last will switch to the right-most tab.

tab_fade 0.25 0.5 0.75 1

#: Control how each tab fades into the background when using fade for
#: the tab_bar_style. Each number is an alpha (between zero and one)
#: that controls how much the corresponding cell fades into the
#: background, with zero being no fade and one being full fade. You
#: can change the number of cells used by adding/removing entries to
#: this list.

tab_separator " â"

#: The separator between tabs in the tab bar when using separator as
#: the tab_bar_style.

tab_powerline_style angled

#: The powerline separator style between tabs in the tab bar when
#: using powerline as the tab_bar_style, can be one of: angled,
#: slanted, round.

tab_activity_symbol none

#: Some text or a Unicode symbol to show on the tab if a window in the
#: tab that does not have focus has some activity. If you want to use
#: leading or trailing spaces, surround the text with quotes. See
#: tab_title_template for how this is rendered.

tab_title_template "{fmt.fg.red}{bell_symbol}{activity_symbol}{fmt.fg.tab}{title}"

#: A template to render the tab title. The default just renders the
#: title with optional symbols for bell and activity. If you wish to
#: include the tab-index as well, use something like: {index}:{title}.
#: Useful if you have shortcuts mapped for goto_tab N. If you prefer
#: to see the index as a superscript, use {sup.index}. All data
#: available is:

#: title
#:     The current tab title.
#: index
#:     The tab index useable with goto_tab N goto_tab shortcuts.
#: layout_name
#:     The current layout name.
#: num_windows
#:     The number of windows in the tab.
#: num_window_groups
#:     The number of window groups (not counting overlay windows) in the tab.
#: tab.active_wd
#:     The working directory of the currently active window in the tab (expensive,
#:     requires syscall).
#: max_title_length
#:     The maximum title length available.

#: Note that formatting is done by Python's string formatting
#: machinery, so you can use, for instance, {layout_name[:2].upper()}
#: to show only the first two letters of the layout name, upper-cased.
#: If you want to style the text, you can use styling directives, for
#: example:
#: `{fmt.fg.red}red{fmt.fg.tab}normal{fmt.bg._00FF00}greenbg{fmt.bg.tab}`.
#: Similarly, for bold and italic:
#: `{fmt.bold}bold{fmt.nobold}normal{fmt.italic}italic{fmt.noitalic}`.
#: Note that for backward compatibility, if {bell_symbol} or
#: {activity_symbol} are not present in the template, they are
#: prepended to it.

active_tab_title_template none

#: Template to use for active tabs. If not specified falls back to
#: tab_title_template.

active_tab_foreground   #000
active_tab_background   #eee
active_tab_font_style   bold-italic
inactive_tab_foreground #444
inactive_tab_background #999
inactive_tab_font_style normal

#: Tab bar colors and styles.

tab_bar_background none

#: Background color for the tab bar. Defaults to using the terminal
#: background color.

tab_bar_margin_color none

#: Color for the tab bar margin area. Defaults to using the terminal
#: background color.

#: }}}

#: Color scheme {{{

foreground #c5c8c6
background #1d1f21

#: The foreground and background colors.

background_opacity 1.0

#: The opacity of the background. A number between zero and one, where
#: one is opaque and zero is fully transparent. This will only work if
#: supported by the OS (for instance, when using a compositor under
#: X11). Note that it only sets the background color's opacity in
#: cells that have the same background color as the default terminal
#: background, so that things like the status bar in vim, powerline
#: prompts, etc. still look good. But it means that if you use a color
#: theme with a background color in your editor, it will not be
#: rendered as transparent. Instead you should change the default
#: background color in your kitty config and not use a background
#: color in the editor color scheme. Or use the escape codes to set
#: the terminals default colors in a shell script to launch your
#: editor. Be aware that using a value less than 1.0 is a (possibly
#: significant) performance hit. If you want to dynamically change
#: transparency of windows, set dynamic_background_opacity to yes
#: (this is off by default as it has a performance cost). Changing
#: this option when reloading the config will only work if
#: dynamic_background_opacity was enabled in the original config.

background_image none

#: Path to a background image. Must be in PNG format.

background_image_layout tiled

#: Whether to tile, scale or clamp the background image. The value can
#: be one of tiled, mirror-tiled, scaled, clamped.

background_image_linear no

#: When background image is scaled, whether linear interpolation
#: should be used.

dynamic_background_opacity no

#: Allow changing of the background_opacity dynamically, using either
#: keyboard shortcuts (increase_background_opacity and
#: decrease_background_opacity) or the remote control facility.
#: Changing this option by reloading the config is not supported.

background_tint 0.0

#: How much to tint the background image by the background color. The
#: tint is applied only under the text area, not margin/borders. This
#: option makes it easier to read the text. Tinting is done using the
#: current background color for each window. This option applies only
#: if background_opacity is set and transparent windows are supported
#: or background_image is set.

dim_opacity 0.75

#: How much to dim text that has the DIM/FAINT attribute set. One
#: means no dimming and zero means fully dimmed (i.e. invisible).

selection_foreground #000000
selection_background #fffacd

#: The foreground and background colors for text selected with the
#: mouse. Setting both of these to none will cause a "reverse video"
#: effect for selections, where the selection will be the cell text
#: color and the text will become the cell background color. Setting
#: only selection_foreground to none will cause the foreground color
#: to be used unchanged. Note that these colors can be overridden by
#: the program running in the terminal.

#: The color table {{{

#: The 256 terminal colors. There are 8 basic colors, each color has a
#: dull and bright version, for the first 16 colors. You can set the
#: remaining 240 colors as color16 to color255.

#: }}}

#: }}}

#: Advanced {{{

shell .

#: The shell program to execute. The default value of . means to use
#: whatever shell is set as the default shell for the current user.
#: Note that on macOS if you change this, you might need to add
#: --login and --interactive to ensure that the shell starts in
#: interactive mode and reads its startup rc files.

editor .

#: The terminal based text editor (such as vim or nano) to use when
#: editing the kitty config file or similar tasks.

#: The default value of . means to use the environment variables
#: VISUAL and EDITOR in that order. If these variables aren't set,
#: kitty will run your shell ($SHELL -l -i -c env) to see if your
#: shell startup rc files set VISUAL or EDITOR. If that doesn't work,
#: kitty will cycle through various known editors (vim, emacs, etc.)
#: and take the first one that exists on your system.

close_on_child_death no

#: Close the window when the child process (shell) exits. With the
#: default value no, the terminal will remain open when the child
#: exits as long as there are still processes outputting to the
#: terminal (for example disowned or backgrounded processes). When
#: enabled with yes, the window will close as soon as the child
#: process exits. Note that setting it to yes means that any
#: background processes still using the terminal can fail silently
#: because their stdout/stderr/stdin no longer work.

# remote_control_password

#: Allow other programs to control kitty using passwords. This option
#: can be specified multiple times to add multiple passwords. If no
#: passwords are present kitty will ask the user for permission if a
#: program tries to use remote control with a password. A password can
#: also *optionally* be associated with a set of allowed remote
#: control actions. For example::

#:     remote_control_password "my passphrase" get-colors set-colors focus-window focus-tab

#: Only the specified actions will be allowed when using this
#: password. Glob patterns can be used too, for example::

#:     remote_control_password "my passphrase" set-tab-* resize-*

#: To get a list of available actions, run::

#:     kitty @ --help

#: A set of actions to be allowed when no password is sent can be
#: specified by using an empty password, for example::

#:     remote_control_password "" *-colors

#: Finally, the path to a python module can be specified that provides
#: a function is_cmd_allowed that is used to check every remote
#: control command. See rc_custom_auth
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/remote-control/#rc-custom-auth>
#: for details. For example::

#:     remote_control_password "my passphrase" my_rc_command_checker.py

#: Relative paths are resolved from the kitty configuration directory.

allow_remote_control yes

#: Allow other programs to control kitty. If you turn this on, other
#: programs can control all aspects of kitty, including sending text
#: to kitty windows, opening new windows, closing windows, reading the
#: content of windows, etc. Note that this even works over SSH
#: connections. The default setting of no prevents any form of remote
#: control. The meaning of the various values are:

#: password
#:    Remote control requests received over both the TTY device and the socket are
#:    confirmed based on passwords, see remote_control_password.

#: socket-only
#:    Remote control requests received over a socket are accepted unconditionally.
#:    Requests received over the TTY are denied. See listen_on.

#: socket
#:    Remote control requests received over a socket are accepted unconditionally.
#:    Requests received over the TTY are confirmed based on password.

#: no
#:    Remote control is completely disabled.

#: yes
#:    Remote control requests are always accepted.

listen_on none

#: Listen to the specified UNIX socket for remote control connections.
#: Note that this will apply to all kitty instances. It can be
#: overridden by the kitty --listen-on command line option, which also
#: supports listening on a TCP socket. This option accepts only UNIX
#: sockets, such as unix:${TEMP}/mykitty or unix:@mykitty (on Linux).
#: Environment variables are expanded and relative paths are resolved
#: with respect to the temporary directory. If {kitty_pid} is present,
#: then it is replaced by the PID of the kitty process, otherwise the
#: PID of the kitty process is appended to the value, with a hyphen.
#: See the help for kitty --listen-on for more details. Note that this
#: will be ignored unless allow_remote_control is set to either: yes,
#: socket or socket-only. Changing this option by reloading the config
#: is not supported.

# env

#: Specify the environment variables to be set in all child processes.
#: Using the name with an equal sign (e.g. env VAR=) will set it to
#: the empty string. Specifying only the name (e.g. env VAR) will
#: remove the variable from the child process' environment. Note that
#: environment variables are expanded recursively, for example::

#:     env VAR1=a
#:     env VAR2=${HOME}/${VAR1}/b

#: The value of VAR2 will be <path to home directory>/a/b.

# watcher

#: Path to python file which will be loaded for watchers
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/launch/#watchers>. Can be
#: specified more than once to load multiple watchers. The watchers
#: will be added to every kitty window. Relative paths are resolved
#: relative to the kitty config directory. Note that reloading the
#: config will only affect windows created after the reload.

watcher fcitx5_watcher.py

# exe_search_path

#: Control where kitty finds the programs to run. The default search
#: order is: First search the system wide PATH, then ~/.local/bin and
#: ~/bin. If still not found, the PATH defined in the login shell
#: after sourcing all its startup files is tried. Finally, if present,
#: the PATH specified by the env option is tried.

#: This option allows you to prepend, append, or remove paths from
#: this search order. It can be specified multiple times for multiple
#: paths. A simple path will be prepended to the search order. A path
#: that starts with the + sign will be append to the search order,
#: after ~/bin above. A path that starts with the - sign will be
#: removed from the entire search order. For example::

#:     exe_search_path /some/prepended/path
#:     exe_search_path +/some/appended/path
#:     exe_search_path -/some/excluded/path

update_check_interval 0

#: The interval to periodically check if an update to kitty is
#: available (in hours). If an update is found, a system notification
#: is displayed informing you of the available update. The default is
#: to check every 24 hours, set to zero to disable. Update checking is
#: only done by the official binary builds. Distro packages or source
#: builds do not do update checking. Changing this option by reloading
#: the config is not supported.

startup_session none

#: Path to a session file to use for all kitty instances. Can be
#: overridden by using the kitty --session command line option for
#: individual instances. See sessions
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/overview/#sessions> in the kitty
#: documentation for details. Note that relative paths are interpreted
#: with respect to the kitty config directory. Environment variables
#: in the path are expanded. Changing this option by reloading the
#: config is not supported.

clipboard_control write-clipboard no-append

#: Allow programs running in kitty to read and write from the
#: clipboard. You can control exactly which actions are allowed. The
#: possible actions are: write-clipboard, read-clipboard, write-
#: primary, read-primary, read-clipboard-ask, read-primary-ask. The
#: default is to allow writing to the clipboard and primary selection
#: and to ask for permission when a program tries to read from the
#: clipboard. Note that disabling the read confirmation is a security
#: risk as it means that any program, even the ones running on a
#: remote server via SSH can read your clipboard. See also
#: clipboard_max_size.

clipboard_max_size 64

#: The maximum size (in MB) of data from programs running in kitty
#: that will be stored for writing to the system clipboard. A value of
#: zero means no size limit is applied. See also clipboard_control.

# file_transfer_confirmation_bypass

#: The password that can be supplied to the file transfer kitten
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/transfer/> to skip the
#: transfer confirmation prompt. This should only be used when
#: initiating transfers from trusted computers, over trusted networks
#: or encrypted transports, as it allows any programs running on the
#: remote machine to read/write to the local filesystem, without
#: permission.

allow_hyperlinks yes

#: Process hyperlink escape sequences (OSC 8). If disabled OSC 8
#: escape sequences are ignored. Otherwise they become clickable
#: links, that you can click with the mouse or by using the hints
#: kitten <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/hints/>. The
#: special value of ask means that kitty will ask before opening the
#: link when clicked.

shell_integration disabled

#: Enable shell integration on supported shells. This enables features
#: such as jumping to previous prompts, browsing the output of the
#: previous command in a pager, etc. on supported shells. Set to
#: disabled to turn off shell integration, completely. It is also
#: possible to disable individual features, set to a space separated
#: list of these values: no-rc, no-cursor, no-title, no-cwd, no-
#: prompt-mark, no-complete. See Shell integration
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/> for details.

allow_cloning ask

#: Control whether programs running in the terminal can request new
#: windows to be created. The canonical example is clone-in-kitty
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/#clone-shell>.
#: By default, kitty will ask for permission for each clone request.
#: Allowing cloning unconditionally gives programs running in the
#: terminal (including over SSH) permission to execute arbitrary code,
#: as the user who is running the terminal, on the computer that the
#: terminal is running on.

clone_source_strategies venv,conda,env_var,path

#: Control what shell code is sourced when running clone-in-kitty in
#: the newly cloned window. The supported strategies are:

#: venv
#:     Source the file $VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/activate. This is used by the
#:     Python stdlib venv module and allows cloning venvs automatically.
#: conda
#:     Run conda activate $CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV. This supports the virtual
#:     environments created by conda.
#: env_var
#:     Execute the contents of the environment variable
#:     KITTY_CLONE_SOURCE_CODE with eval.
#: path
#:     Source the file pointed to by the environment variable
#:     KITTY_CLONE_SOURCE_PATH.

#: This option must be a comma separated list of the above values.
#: This only source the first valid one in the above order.

term xterm-kitty

#: The value of the TERM environment variable to set. Changing this
#: can break many terminal programs, only change it if you know what
#: you are doing, not because you read some advice on "Stack Overflow"
#: to change it. The TERM variable is used by various programs to get
#: information about the capabilities and behavior of the terminal. If
#: you change it, depending on what programs you run, and how
#: different the terminal you are changing it to is, various things
#: from key-presses, to colors, to various advanced features may not
#: work. Changing this option by reloading the config will only affect
#: newly created windows.

#: }}}

#: OS specific tweaks {{{

wayland_titlebar_color system

#: The color of the kitty window's titlebar on Wayland systems with
#: client side window decorations such as GNOME. A value of system
#: means to use the default system color, a value of background means
#: to use the background color of the currently active window and
#: finally you can use an arbitrary color, such as #12af59 or red.

macos_titlebar_color system

#: The color of the kitty window's titlebar on macOS. A value of
#: system means to use the default system color, light or dark can
#: also be used to set it explicitly. A value of background means to
#: use the background color of the currently active window and finally
#: you can use an arbitrary color, such as #12af59 or red. WARNING:
#: This option works by using a hack when arbitrary color (or
#: background) is configured, as there is no proper Cocoa API for it.
#: It sets the background color of the entire window and makes the
#: titlebar transparent. As such it is incompatible with
#: background_opacity. If you want to use both, you are probably
#: better off just hiding the titlebar with hide_window_decorations.

macos_option_as_alt no

#: Use the Option key as an Alt key on macOS. With this set to no,
#: kitty will use the macOS native Option+Key to enter Unicode
#: character behavior. This will break any Alt+Key keyboard shortcuts
#: in your terminal programs, but you can use the macOS Unicode input
#: technique. You can use the values: left, right or both to use only
#: the left, right or both Option keys as Alt, instead. Note that
#: kitty itself always treats Option the same as Alt. This means you
#: cannot use this option to configure different kitty shortcuts for
#: Option+Key vs. Alt+Key. Also, any kitty shortcuts using
#: Option/Alt+Key will take priority, so that any such key presses
#: will not be passed to terminal programs running inside kitty.
#: Changing this option by reloading the config is not supported.

macos_hide_from_tasks no

#: Hide the kitty window from running tasks on macOS (â+Tab and the
#: Dock). Changing this option by reloading the config is not
#: supported.

macos_quit_when_last_window_closed no

#: Have kitty quit when all the top-level windows are closed on macOS.
#: By default, kitty will stay running, even with no open windows, as
#: is the expected behavior on macOS.

macos_window_resizable yes

#: Disable this if you want kitty top-level OS windows to not be
#: resizable on macOS. Changing this option by reloading the config
#: will only affect newly created OS windows.

macos_thicken_font 0

#: Draw an extra border around the font with the given width, to
#: increase legibility at small font sizes on macOS. For example, a
#: value of 0.75 will result in rendering that looks similar to sub-
#: pixel antialiasing at common font sizes.

macos_traditional_fullscreen no

#: Use the macOS traditional full-screen transition, that is faster,
#: but less pretty.

macos_show_window_title_in all

#: Control where the window title is displayed on macOS. A value of
#: window will show the title of the currently active window at the
#: top of the macOS window. A value of menubar will show the title of
#: the currently active window in the macOS global menu bar, making
#: use of otherwise wasted space. A value of all will show the title
#: in both places, and none hides the title. See
#: macos_menubar_title_max_length for how to control the length of the
#: title in the menu bar.

macos_menubar_title_max_length 0

#: The maximum number of characters from the window title to show in
#: the macOS global menu bar. Values less than one means that there is
#: no maximum limit.

macos_custom_beam_cursor no

#: Use a custom mouse cursor for macOS that is easier to see on both
#: light and dark backgrounds. Nowadays, the default macOS cursor
#: already comes with a white border. WARNING: this might make your
#: mouse cursor invisible on dual GPU machines. Changing this option
#: by reloading the config is not supported.

macos_colorspace srgb

#: The colorspace in which to interpret terminal colors. The default
#: of srgb will cause colors to match those seen in web browsers. The
#: value of default will use whatever the native colorspace of the
#: display is. The value of displayp3 will use Apple's special
#: snowflake display P3 color space, which will result in over
#: saturated (brighter) colors with some color shift. Reloading
#: configuration will change this value only for newly created OS
#: windows.

linux_display_server auto

#: Choose between Wayland and X11 backends. By default, an appropriate
#: backend based on the system state is chosen automatically. Set it
#: to x11 or wayland to force the choice. Changing this option by
#: reloading the config is not supported.
